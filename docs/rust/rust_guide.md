!!! note

    The Rust project is currently in progress. There is not a working toolchain or compiler available.


To get started on contributing to the H-hat's project in Rust:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hhat-lang/hhat_lang.git
   ```
2. Set a Python environment. Check [Python guide](../python/python_guide.md). This is necessary for documentation purposes and some other FFI needs (when handling external quantum libraries in Python).
3. Please use `cargo check` and `cargo audit` when working on Rust.
