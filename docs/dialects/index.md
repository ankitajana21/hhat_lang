# H-hat Dialects

H-hat has no official syntax; only a [minimum set of rules](../rule_system.md) that must be implemented for a language to be considered part of the H-hat language family, or its dialect. However, there is a default dialect for now called [Heather](heather/index.md). It is shipped with H-hat toolchain to enable users to build programs using the H-hat paradigm. Plans to enable out-of-the-box tools to build your own dialect are on future roadmaps.
